# Notes for MCV

You can view the notes by opening '.html' file. The source is in '.md' files and the syntax is [Julia Markdown](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Markdown/) + [Katex](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html).

Module 3 and 4 are in progress. It will take to much time for me to make all of the notes so please contribute by pointing out issues (both in content and english) and merging your notes.

If you want to contribute with your notes:

* I use vscode (+ mdmath extension)
* You could either
  - use the same setup and regenerate html
  - contribute just markdown + katex and let me regenerate html

I will try to maintain a balance between giving the details and staying coincise. If you think I omitted something worth mentioning, please tell me.

Happy studying!
